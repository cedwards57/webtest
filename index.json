A common and plausible assumption is that higher measurement frequencies are the only way to gain more informative data about the underlying dynamical causal structure. This assumption is a strong driver for designing new, faster instruments, but such instruments might not be feasible or even possible. In this paper, we show that this assumption is incorrect: there are situations in which we can gain additional information about the causal structure by measuring more than our current instruments. We present an algorithm that uses graphs at multiple measurement timescales to infer underlying causal structure, and show that inclusion of structures at slower timescales can nonetheless reduce the size of the equivalence class of possible causal structures. We provide simulation data about the probability of cases in which deliberate undersampling yields a gain, as well as the size of this gain.\nView article\n","date":"February 20, 2023","hero":"/webtest/images/default-hero.png","permalink":"https://cedwards57.github.io/webtest/posts/papers/causal-learning-through-deliberate-undersampling/","summary":"Authors : Kseniya Solovyeva, David Danks, Mohammadsajad Abavisani, Sergey Plis\nPublication date : 2023/2/20\nJournal : Proceedings of Machine Learning Research\nVolume : 13\nIssue :\nPages :\nPublisher : Cambridge MA: JMLR\nDescription\nDomain scientists interested in causal mechanisms are usually limited by the frequency at which they can collect the measurements of social, physical, or biological systems.

Critically, supervised models in clinical settings lack accurate diagnostic labels for training. Coarse labels do not capture the long-tailed spectrum of brain disorder phenotypes, which leads to a loss of generalizability of the model that makes them less useful in diagnostic settings. This work presents a novel multi-scale coordinated framework for learning multiple representations from multimodal neuroimaging data. We propose a general taxonomy of informative inductive biases to capture unique and joint information in multimodal self-supervised fusion. The taxonomy forms a family of decoder-free models with reduced computational complexity and a propensity to capture multi-scale relationships between local and global representations of the multimodal inputs. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the taxonomy using functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data across a spectrum of Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease phenotypes and show that self-supervised models reveal disorder-relevant brain regions and multimodal links without access to the labels during pre-training. The proposed multimodal self-supervised learning yields representations with improved classification performance for both modalities.

MRI data usually requires extensive preprocessing before it is ready for modeling, even via deep learning, in part due to its high dimensionality and heterogeneity. A growing array of MRI preprocessing pipelines have been developed each with its own strengths and limitations. Recent studies have shown that pipeline-related variation may lead to different scientific findings, even when using the identical data. Meanwhile, the machine learning community has emphasized the importance of shifting from model-centric to data-centric approaches given that data quality plays an essential role in deep learning applications. Motivated by this idea, we first evaluate how preprocessing pipeline selection can impact the downstream performance of a supervised learning model. We next propose two pipeline-invariant representation learning methodologies, MPSL and PXL, to improve consistency in classification performance and to capture similar neural network representations between pipeline pairs. Using 2000 human subjects from the UK Biobank dataset, we demonstrate that both models present unique advantages, in particular that MPSL can be used to improve out-of-sample generalization to new pipelines, while PXL can be used to improve predictive performance consistency and representational similarity within a closed pipeline set.

However, a typical sliding window plus clustering (SWC) approach for analyzing dFNC models the system through a fixed sequence of connectivity states. SWC assumes connectivity patterns span throughout the brain, but they are relatively spatially constrained and temporally short‐lived in practice. Thus, SWC is neither designed to capture transient dynamic changes nor heterogeneity across subjects/time. We propose a state‐space time series summarization framework called “statelets” to address these shortcomings.

Although this problem has been recently recognized, practitioners have limited resources to respond to it, and so must continue using models that they know are likely misleading. Existing methods either (a) require that the difference between causal and measurement timescales is known; or (b) can handle only very small number of random variables when the timescale difference is unknown; or (c) apply to only pairs of variables, though with fewer assumptions about prior knowledge; or (d) return impractically too many solutions. This paper addresses all four challenges. We combine constraint programming with both theoretical insights into the problem structure and prior information about admissible causal interactions. The resulting system provides a practical approach that scales to significantly larger sets (\u0026gt;100) of random variables, does not require precise knowledge of the timescale difference, supports edge misidentification and parametric connection strengths, and can provide the optimum choice among many possible solutions. The cumulative impact of these improvements is gain of multiple orders of magnitude in speed and informativeness.\nView article\n","date":"May 18, 2022","hero":"/webtest/images/default-hero.png","permalink":"https://cedwards57.github.io/webtest/posts/papers/constraint-based-causal-structure-learning-from-undersampled-graphs/","summary":"Authors : Mohammadsajad Abavisani, David Danks, Sergey Plis\nPublication date : 2022/5/18\nJournal : arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.09235\nDescription\nGraphical structures estimated by causal learning algorithms from time series data can provide highly misleading causal information if the causal timescale of the generating process fails to match the measurement timescale of the data.

However, researchers often have limited access to neuroimaging data because of its challenging and expensive acquisition process, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the predictive model. Decentralized models provide a way to build more accurate and generalizable prediction models, bypassing the traditional data-sharing methodology. In this work, we propose a decentralized method for biological brain age estimation using support vector regression models and evaluate it on three different feature sets, including both volumetric and voxelwise structural MRI data as well as resting functional MRI data. The results demonstrate that our decentralized brain age …\nView article\n","date":"April 5, 2022","hero":"/webtest/images/default-hero.png","permalink":"https://cedwards57.github.io/webtest/posts/papers/decentralized-brain-age-estimation-using-mri-data/","summary":"Authors : Sunitha Basodi, Rajikha Raja, Bhaskar Ray, Harshvardhan Gazula, Anand D Sarwate, Sergey Plis, Jingyu Liu, Eric Verner, Vince D Calhoun\nPublication date : 2022/4/5\nJournal : Neuroinformatics\nPages : 1-10\nPublisher : Springer US\nDescription\nRecent studies have demonstrated that neuroimaging data can be used to estimate biological brain age, as it captures information about the neuroanatomical and functional changes the brain undergoes during development and the aging process.","tags":["Paper","Publications"],"title":"Decentralized Brain Age Estimation using MRI Data"},{"categories":["Publications"],"contents":"Authors : Md Mahfuzur Rahman, Noah Lewis, Sergey Plis\nPublication date : 2014/3/1\nConference : ICLR 2022 Workshop on PAIR {\\textasciicircum\nDescription\nInterpretability methods for deep neural networks mainly focus on modifying the rules of automatic differentiation or perturbing the input and observing the score drop to determine the most relevant features.

One such initiative is the Neuromark, a fully automated spatially constrained independent component analysis (ICA) that is used to link brain network abnormalities among different datasets, studies, and disorders while leveraging subject-specific networks. In this study, we implement the neuromark pipeline in COINSTAC, an open-source neuroimaging framework for collaborative/decentralized analysis. Decentralized analysis of nearly 2000 resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets collected at different sites across two cohorts and co-located in different countries was performed to study the resting brain functional network connectivity changes in adolescents who smoke and consume alcohol. Results showed hypoconnectivity across the majority of networks including sensory, default mode, and subcortical domains, more for alcohol than smoking, and decreased low frequency power. These findings suggest that global reduced synchronization is associated with both tobacco and alcohol use. This work demonstrates the utility and incentives associated with large-scale decentralized collaborations spanning multiple sites.\nView article\n","date":"January 1, 2022","hero":"/webtest/images/default-hero.png","permalink":"https://cedwards57.github.io/webtest/posts/papers/federated-analysis-in-coinstac-reveals-functional-network-connectivity-and-spectral-links-to-smoking-and-alcohol-consumption-in-nearly-2000-adolescent-brains/","summary":"Authors : Harshvardhan Gazula, Kelly Rootes-Murdy, Bharath Holla, Sunitha Basodi, Zuo Zhang, Eric Verner, Ross Kelly, Pratima Murthy, Amit Chakrabarti, Debasish Basu, Subodh Bhagyalakshmi Nanjayya, Rajkumar Lenin Singh, Roshan Lourembam Singh, Kartik Kalyanram, Kamakshi Kartik, Kumaran Kalyanaraman, Krishnaveni Ghattu, Rebecca Kuriyan, Sunita Simon Kurpad, Gareth J Barker, Rose Dawn Bharath, Sylvane Desrivieres, Meera Purushottam, Dimitri Papadopoulos Orfanos, Eesha Sharma, Matthew Hickman, Mireille Toledano, Nilakshi Vaidya, Tobias Banaschewski, Arun LW Bokde, Herta Flor, Antoine Grigis, Hugh Garavan, Penny Gowland, Andreas Heinz, Rüdiger Brühl, Jean-Luc Martinot, Marie-Laure Paillère Martinot, Eric Artiges, Frauke Nees, Tomáš Paus, Luise Poustka, Juliane H Fröhner, Lauren Robinson, Michael N Smolka, Henrik Walter, Jeanne Winterer, Robert Whelan, Jessica A Turner, Anand D Sarwate, Sergey M Plis, Vivek Benegal, Gunter Schumann, Vince D Calhoun, IMAGEN Consortium","tags":["Paper","Publications"],"title":"Federated analysis in COINSTAC reveals functional network connectivity and spectral links to smoking and alcohol consumption in nearly 2,000 adolescent brains"},{"categories":["Publications"],"contents":"Authors : Haleh Falakshahi, Hooman Rokham, Zening Fu, Armin Iraji, Daniel H Mathalon, Judith M Ford, Bryon A Mueller, Adrian Preda, Theo GM van Erp, Jessica A Turner, Sergey Plis, Vince D Calhoun\nPublication date : 2022/1\nJournal : Network Neuroscience\nPages : 1-45\nDescription\nGraph-theoretical methods have been widely used to study human brain networks in psychiatric disorders.

Large neural networks employed in the framework are traditionally associated with better generalization capabilities, but their increased size entails the drawbacks of extensive training duration, substantial hardware resources, and longer inference times. One way to tackle this problem is to prune neural networks leaving only the necessary parameters. State-of-the-art concurrent pruning techniques for imposing sparsity perform demonstrably well in applications where data distributions are fixed. However, they have not yet been substantially explored in the context of RL. We close the gap between RL and single-shot pruning techniques and present a general pruning approach to the Offline RL. We leverage a fixed dataset to prune neural networks before the start of RL training. We then run experiments varying the network sparsity level and evaluating the validity of pruning at initialization techniques in continuous control tasks. Our results show that with 95% of the network weights pruned, Offline-RL algorithms can still retain performance in the majority of our experiments. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work utilizing pruning in RL retained performance at such high levels of sparsity. Moreover, pruning at initialization techniques can be easily integrated into any existing Offline-RL algorithms without changing the learning objective.\nView article\n","date":"December 31, 2021","hero":"/webtest/images/default-hero.png","permalink":"https://cedwards57.github.io/webtest/posts/papers/single-shot-pruning-for-offline-reinforcement-learning/","summary":"Authors : Samin Yeasar Arnob, Riyasat Ohib, Sergey Plis, Doina Precup\nPublication date : 2021/12/31\nJournal : arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.15579\nDescription\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful framework for solving complex real-world problems.
