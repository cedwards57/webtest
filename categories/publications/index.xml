Description
Domain scientists interested in causal mechanisms are usually limited by the frequency at which they can collect the measurements of social, physical, or biological systems. A common and plausible assumption is that higher measurement frequencies are the only way to gain more informative data about the underlying dynamical causal structure.</description>

Publication date : 2022/8/27
Journal : arXiv preprint arXiv:2208.12909
Description
Deep learning has been widely applied in neuroimaging, including to predicting brain-phenotype relationships from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes. MRI data usually requires extensive preprocessing before it is ready for modeling, even via deep learning, in part due to its high dimensionality and heterogeneity. A growing array of MRI preprocessing pipelines have been developed each with its own strengths and limitations.</description>

Dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) analysis is a widely used approach for capturing brain activation patterns, connectivity states, and network organization. However, a typical sliding window plus clustering (SWC) approach for analyzing dFNC models the system through a fixed sequence of connectivity states.</description>

Publication date : 2022/5/18
Journal : arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.09235
Description
Graphical structures estimated by causal learning algorithms from time series data can provide highly misleading causal information if the causal timescale of the generating process fails to match the measurement timescale of the data. Although this problem has been recently recognized, practitioners have limited resources to respond to it, and so must continue using models that they know are likely misleading.</description>

Conference : ICLR 2022 Workshop on PAIR {\textasciicircum
Description
Interpretability methods for deep neural networks mainly focus on modifying the rules of automatic differentiation or perturbing the input and observing the score drop to determine the most relevant features. Among them, gradient-based attribution methods, such as saliency maps, are arguably the most popular. Still, the produced saliency maps may often lack intelligibility.</description>

Description
Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful framework for solving complex real-world problems. Large neural networks employed in the framework are traditionally associated with better generalization capabilities, but their increased size entails the drawbacks of extensive training duration, substantial hardware resources, and longer inference times. One way to tackle this problem is to prune neural networks leaving only the necessary parameters.</description>

Description
The field of neuroimaging has embraced sharing data to collaboratively advance our understanding of the brain. However, data sharing, especially across sites with large amounts of protected health information (PHI), can be cumbersome and time intensive. Recently, there has been a greater push towards collaborative frameworks that enable large-scale federated analysis of neuroimaging data without the data having to leave its original location.</description>

Volume : 24
Issue : 3
Pages : 663-676
Publisher : Oxford University Press
Description
Spontaneous fluctuations are a hallmark of recordings of neural signals, emergent over time scales spanning milliseconds and tens of minutes. However, investigations of intrinsic brain organization based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging have largely not taken into account the presence and potential of temporal variability, as most current approaches to examine functional connectivity (FC) implicitly assume that relationships are constant throughout the length of the recording.</description>
