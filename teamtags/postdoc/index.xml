      <description>I have completed my PhD in Biophysics and Masters in Applied Physics and Mathematics in Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Russia.Â My research interests center on the mechanisms of the brain and consciousness. My main goal is to create a technology for deliberately changing the state of consciousness to achieve states most suitable for effective work, learning, or therapy. I believe that we need high-quality brain models to reach this goal.</description>
